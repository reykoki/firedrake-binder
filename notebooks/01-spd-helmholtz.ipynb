Firedrake uses *mesh markers* to select which parts of the mesh the integral measure should integrate over.  These are integers (or tuples thereof) that have some meaning for the mesh.  Most external mesh generators will have some way of marking meshes in this way.  For the utility meshes, the docstring indicates which markers correspond to which parts of the mesh.  So let's look:"
